# Berkeley-climate-date
Visualization of climate change using data collected by [Berkeley Earth](http://berkeleyearth.org/source-files/).

## Goal
This project aims to, without bias, visualize climate change.
## Datasets
The datasets included in this project are the "Colonial Era Weather Archive (CA)," "GHCN Daily," and "Monthly Climatic Data of the World."

One may visualize other datasets attained from [this link](http://berkeleyearth.org/source-files/) by following the steps in the Jupyter notebook.

## To-Do
I would love to enhance this project. However, my time is currently being allocated to other projects. If you would like to contribute to this repository, but do not know how, here are some features I would like to implement:

* Offering the choice of which datasets to visualize
* Adding more Berkeley Earth datasets to this repository by following the instructions in the notebook.
* Writing a program to automatically clean the `tsv` files from Berkeley Earth.
* Enabling easier distinction between overlapping circle elements.
  * This could possibly be done with a zoom function [(1)](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/c1c0426d50ca8a9f4c97) [(2)](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4132797) or by changing the z-index of circles.
* Visualizing some sort of average for the data
  * Perhaps average per region/continent or global average.
